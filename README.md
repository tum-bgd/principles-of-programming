# Principles Of Programming

Test repository for PoP students to practice version control.

## Tasks

The goal is to practice working with `git`.

1. Create a `GitHub` account.
2. Set up `SSH` access <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh> (Optional)
3. Fork or checkout this repository locally.
4. Create your own branch.
5. Add your code and commit it.
6. Push to origin and open a pull request (assign @b4l as reviewer).

## Algorithms

These are some suggestions of algorithms to implement. 

* Point in polygon: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon>
* Scanline rendering: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanline_rendering>
* Anything from this list: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms>
* Advent of Code: <https://adventofcode.com>

You can also choose something of your own.

## Hints

* Put all your code in a subfolder to prevent merge conflicts.
* Choose a simple algorithm/challenge.
* Describe it concisely with original sources/citations.
* If you have any issues, open an issue.
